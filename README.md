# 🃏 Poker Monte Carlo Simulator

A Python project that uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the winning probabilities of poker hands.  
This tool lets you input hole cards and community cards, then runs thousands of random simulations to calculate equity (win/tie/loss percentages).

## 🚀 Features
- Simulates **Texas Hold’em** poker hands
- Estimates winning probability using **Monte Carlo methods**
- Supports **multiple players**
- Clean object-oriented design (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Simulator`)
- Includes visualizations (probability distributions, EV graphs)
- Extendable to other variants or strategy analysis
